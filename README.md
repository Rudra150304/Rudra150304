🔥 Rudra Pratap Singh — Systems & ML Engineer
CSE Student | Low-Level Engineering | C++ • ML • Systems Design

Hi, I’m Rudra — a systems-focused developer building high-performance, low-level tools using C++ and GPU acceleration.
I love engineering that interacts directly with the OS: shells, terminals, memory, processes, performance, and ML internals.

🚀 What I Do

Systems Programming — shells, terminals, processes, signals, pipelines, filesystems

Machine Learning in C++ — implementing algorithms from scratch (using the Packt repo + book Hands-On Machine Learning with C++)

High-Performance Tools — GPU-accelerated terminal + offline AI

Rust (Learning) — exploring the language; not proficient yet

ML Mathematics — learning from NPTEL’s Essential Mathematics for Machine Learning – IIT Roorkee

🧠 Current Major Projects

🔹 CerebroShell

A GPU-accelerated terminal with an AI layer built directly into the workflow.

Core Features:

GPU-accelerated custom terminal

AI layer powered by Qwen2.5 7B (local)

Hotkey-triggered AI interface between user input and shell

AI suggests the command → asks for yes/no → executes via Bash

Designed for clean UX, speed, and reliability

🔹 Codecrafters Shell

Building a real shell from scratch:

fork, exec, pipes

PATH resolution

Basic builtins

Parser and job control (in progress)

Following real shell architecture closely

🔹 ML in C++

Studying and implementing ML concepts from:

Hands-On Machine Learning with C++ (Packt)

Official Packt GitHub repo for the book

NPTEL course: Essential Mathematics for Machine Learning – IIT Roorkee

Focus areas:

Linear models, decision trees, optimization

HDF5 data loading (HighFive)

Training loops and evaluation

🛠 Tech Stack
Core Languages
